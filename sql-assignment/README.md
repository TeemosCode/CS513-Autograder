Changes made only to evaluate.py file to add fucntion to the auto-grader so that it could also handle submitted files under another sub-folder, by moving those files out of the sub-folder to fit the initial need of the auto-grader.

There is another extra evaluate python file "evaluate_development_with_comment.py" file which is used for development, with detailed comments. The other original evaluate.py has the same content but without the comments (For deploying to Coursera).
